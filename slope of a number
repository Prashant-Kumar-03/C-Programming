slope of a number:  what I define slope of a number is  sum of total no. of  minimas and maximas of a number ...
you might be wondering  how can a number has slope, as we have studied, only lines have slope     I want you to forget about those slopes whatever you know 
so now let's come back to topic  
as we discussed  for slopes we need total no. of minimas and maximas
      now you may have question what is minima and maxima of a number
so let's discuss:
            take an n digits number , now what you do is take ith digit of that number 
                    if that ith digit is greater than i-1 th digit and i+1th digit, then that ith digit is called as maxima
                    similarly if that ith digit is less than i-1 th digit and i+1th digit, then that ith digit is called as maxima
                    and if some of the the digits doesn't have it's either neighbour (right neighbourhood or left neighbourhod) then that digit is neither maxima nor minima   
            so how many of the digits is maxima and how many is minima    count the no. of it and sum it  result is your slopes...
for example :
take a number   let's say 1214
1214  has digits   
1   2  1  4
              
              let's take first digit i.e; 1  
                                          it doesn't have left neighbour  so ignore it or understand it as it is neither maxima and nor minima
              now take second digit  i.e; 2 
                                          left neighbour is 1  and right neighbour is 1   as 2>1 and 2>1     2 is our maxima    so we got one maxima
              if you see the next 1    
                                        1<2 and 1<4   so 1 is our minima    so we have one minima    
              for 4   
                      again we need to ignore it because it doesn't have right neighbourhood   so consider this also as it is  neither maxima nor minima
so we have total 1 minima and 1 maxima 
so slope of 1214 is 1+1=2

for 1220
        we have 1 2 2 0
        for 1
              neither maxima nor minima
        for 2 
              2>1 and 2=2   
              neither maxima nor minima  (it has to be either greater than or smaller than  not even equal to)
        for 2
              2=2 2>0  
              neither maxima nor minima 
        for 0   
              obv neither maxima nor minima



so for this concept we are going to write a code 
first code will be:
          write a c program to find out the slope of a number 
          input: an integer number    can be upto 6 digits
          output: an integer representing slope of that number

second code will be :
          write a c program to find out the sum of the slopes of the number betwenn the ranges including those two numbere
          input: 2 integers  (first one should be less than second one)
          output: sum of the slopes of all the numbers
